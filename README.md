# Gil's dotfiles & setup

[mathias's readme](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/) is awesome. go read it.

This is a mashup between [Paul Irish's dotfiles](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles) and [Ra√∫l Uranga's powerbook](https://github.com/rauluranga/powerbook)

## install the necessary apps

The basic setup is deployed in `install.sh` which adds a ton of stuff: homebrew (node, php, mongo, mysql), cask, rvm, npm global packages, z, etc.

## private config

Toss it into a file called `.extra` which you do not commit to this repo and just keep in your `~/`


```shell
## PATH like a bawss
      PATH=/opt/local/bin
PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/sbin

PATH=$PATH:/bin

PATH=$PATH:~/.rvm/bin

PATH=$PATH:~/code/git-friendly

export PATH
```


## Sensible OS X defaults

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible OS X defaults:

```bash
./.osx
```

## Similar projects

I recommend getting a [`.jshintrc`](https://github.com/jshint/node-jshint/blob/master/.jshintrc) and [`.editorconfig`](http://editorconfig.org/) defined for all your projects.
